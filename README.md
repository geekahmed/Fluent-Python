# Fluent Python
Python's ease of use can lead to underutilized potential. Many programmers rely on familiar patterns from other languages, or on basic Python taught in introductory materials. This text aims to address this by highlighting Python's unique features (e.g., tuple unpacking, descriptors). Its focus is on core language elements, not providing a comprehensive reference.

## Who Should Read This Book?
**Target Audience**

This book is intended for existing Python programmers seeking to enhance their Python 3 proficiency.  Familiarity with the official Python tutorial is presumed, as core concepts won't be re-explained.  It mainly uses Python 3.10 (some compatibility with 3.9/3.8).  

**Not Suitable For**

This book is not suitable for beginner-level Python learners. It assumes existing understanding and may be overwhelming for those just starting with the language. Overly abstract approaches in early Python learning are discouraged.
